What is the Observer Pattern?

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the Subject) changes state, all its dependent objects (Observers) are notified and updated automatically.

Use Cases

The Observer Pattern is commonly used in:


Stock market applications (e.g., updating stock prices for multiple users)
Youtube Channel: to update the subscribers


How It Works

The Subject maintains a list of observers and provides methods to add, remove, and notify observers.

The Observers implement an interface that defines an update() method.

When the Subject's state changes, it calls the update() method of all registered observers.
